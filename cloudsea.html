			<p>Nothing is known of the pit from this point forward, but this particular point is equal parts like a reprieve and a hint of things to come. Free from the horrors before it and in a spot whose wide expanse could be mistaken for the surface itself, this strangely bright locale is the very picture of a daylight sky. Through traversal of mixed together walkways and machinery dig into the stone, many manner of flight-capable creature dwells here, human-like and animal both. Because of the many horrors sprinkled in with the benign, focus on the creatures by the children has been less about the serrated-mouthed four legged bird seemingly in control of this sector or the creatures resembling human children's upper body with a bird's coat grafted over them and instead on the tusk-mouthed creatures that instill memories of the <strong>Peryton</strong> found in old fantasy stories.</p>
