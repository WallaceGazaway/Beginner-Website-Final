Given their name by the children in the pit noting the water dribling from them, these stone titans are responsible for the water erosion below. Furthermore, within them are held horrid human-shaped holes and strange contraptions in a coiling spire." class="paragraphpicture">

			<h2>Ecosystem of the Sector</h2>
			<p>The deeper reaches of the world below were of great concern to the populace upon discovery. Strange mechanisms and seemingly ancient technology from long-swallowed peoples before them jute out from the walls of sky canyons beyond the upper caves, and further exploration into these structures may find individuals in strange spiral hollows dotted with man-shaped holes in the walls interconnected with old pipes. Worse yet, from here on the creatures of the deep take on a notably and disturbingly warped appearance, as if they were cobbled together using human pieces. Unbeknownst to the higher ups above, these factory-like shells are themselves held inside formations like that of inverted mountains, and the abyss goes even deeper from there.</p>
