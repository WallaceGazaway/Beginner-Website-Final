			<h2>Ecosystem of the Sector</h2>
			<p>The caves connecting the myriad layers of this realm are considered some of the most lethal regions, even in the upper levels. This stems largely from the nigh total darkness, coupled with the multitude of sensory-based creatures within the dark, as well as sudden drops from seeming openings. Considered among the worst of the creatures is the <strong>Fire Whisperer</strong>. Light sources are one's only companion in the dark, but these grossly elongated-lipped humanoids will begin to incessantly mutter if they feel the warm touch of light on thier skin, their words causing the fire in the lantern to grow in intensity till it burns itself out, leaving the journier defenceless against them.</p>
