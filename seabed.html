			<h2>Ecosystem of the Sector</h2>
			<p>Perpetual water-erosion from the contaminated water above has caused the landscape of these deeper and wider expanding caves to take on a resemblance to a seabed without the sea. Inside this alien landscape lives all manner of things, some recognized from levels above, and some so offputtingly alien. There lives amalgams of snail and tortoise who are capable of speed beyond either creature through the use of its limbs, great weight, and slick slime to shoot forward like a puck. Here also lives creatures seemingly parasitically overtaken and mutated by coral-like growths, and, worst of all, open mawed creatures whose human appearance bears uncomfortable resemblance to that of an overly bloated corpse.</p>
