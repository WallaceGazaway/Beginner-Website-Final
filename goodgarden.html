			<img src="images/Forest.png" alt="The world below the surfaces' uppermost layer has often been referred to by the children made to scurry inside it as GoodGarden. Called a largely benign sector, even the average surface layman has been allowed unrestricted entry into this sector for food and supplies. Though whether this is due to actual safety or simply a means to ensure this strange underground forest continues to get nutrients through the bodies littering it is up to much debate on the surface." class="paragraphpicture">

			<h2>Ecosystem of the Sector</h2>
			<p>The creatures dwelling in the pit are of a very peculiar sort. They appear nowhere else above-ground, only in the pit itself. The lifeforms of the uppermost sector seem to be the tamest of their ilk. Despite their strange appearances, they still largely follow the logic of the average animal, such as with the deer-like creatures at the top of the forest's foodchain. With the body of a deer, and a head like a cross between owl and moth, this creature camoglauges with its green-down covered body, and it scares its opposition with fake eyes. The whale-like mouth on their face has lead the children who found it to call it the <strong>Smile Stag</strong>.</p>
