			<h2>Ecosystem of the Sector</h2>
			<p>Within this place where water resembling blood due to rust and filth flows from dead trees fused with old pipes, a great many horrid things that could thrive in such a place have settled. Within the Bloodrust Bog there have been found living organ-like parasites that hide away in the filthy water to entangle prey, and living murk with the heads of owls and the bodies of men ready to drown the unassuming if the parasites dont get them. Even the sky is infested with vile harpy-like creatures with empty bowl-like heads and a giant brain for a lower body, like some insect's abdomen. Worse yet, the air bubbles coming up from below imply there are still yet more places even deeper below, passed this vile underground bog formed of the congregated waters of the seabed above.</p>
